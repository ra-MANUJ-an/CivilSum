Dataset and code for the paper "CivilSum: A Dataset for Abstractive Summarization of Court Decisions" which appears in [SIGIR 2024](https://sigir-2024.github.io/index.html).

## Introduction

We provide both the code base and the dataset used in the research, aiming to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of legal document summarization methods. Our contribution includes the introduction of *CivilSum*, a comprehensive collection of 23,350 legal case decisions from the Supreme Court of India and other Indian High Courts, paired with human-written summaries. *CivilSum* stands out not only for its larger volume of legal decisions but also for providing shorter and more abstractive summaries, setting it as a challenging benchmark for legal summarization.
